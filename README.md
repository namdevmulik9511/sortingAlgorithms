#1.
It is the simplest sort method which performs sorting by repeatedly moving the largest element to the highest index of the array. It comprises of comparing each element to its adjacent element and replace them accordingly
#2.
Merge sort follows divide and conquer approach in which, the list is first divided into the sets of equal elements and then each half of the list is sorted by using merge sort. The sorted list is combined again to form an elementary sorted array.
#3.
Quick sort is the most optimized sort algorithms which performs sorting in O(n log n) comparisons. Like Merge sort, quick sort also work by using divide and conquer approach.
#4.
In the heap sort, Min heap or max heap is maintained from the array elements deending upon the choice and the elements are sorted by deleting the root element of the heap
#5.
Linear Search Algorithm is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set.
#6.
Binary search is one of the searching techniques applied when the input is sorted here we are focusing on finding the middle element that acts as a reference frame whether to go left or right to it as the elements are already sorted. This searching helps in optimizing the search technique with every iteration is referred to as binary search and readers do stress over it as it is indirectly applied in solving questions
